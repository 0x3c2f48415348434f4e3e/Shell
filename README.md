# Shell
Simple shell I am currently working on writtent in C.
# Current Features
Some current features incude:
1. Ability to clear terminal
2. Ability to list files and directory in current path
3. Ability to Exit shell
4. Ability to get device IP
5. Ability to get extra information related to the syste, such as IPv4 and IPv4

requires advanced knowledge of C.
